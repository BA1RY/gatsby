title: Set Up Your Development Environment

## Introduction

Welcome to the Gatsby Tutorial! We're excited you're here.

Before you start building your first Gatsby site, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with some core web technologies and make sure that you have installed all required software tools.

## Background Knowledge

The Tutorial is intended to be approachable as approachable as possible for people who are new to Gatsby and React. With that said, if you are brand new to web development (welcome!), you might find it helpful to learn some fundamentals first.

> Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert with these! A high-level understanding of the basics should be enough. You'll pick up a lot through the course of the Tutorial.

* **HTML**: A markup language that every web browser is able to understand. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. You use HTML to add structure to your web content, defining things like headings, paragraphs, and more.
    * Learn more about HTML with the [Basic HTML and HTML5 course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5).
* **CSS**: A presentational language used to style the appearance of your web content (fonts, colors, layout, etc). It stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    * Learn more about CSS with the [Basic CSS course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css).
* **JavaScript**: A programming language that lets you make your web content dynamic and interactive.
    * Learn more about JavaScript with the [Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript).
* The **command line**: The command line is a text-based interface used to run commands on your computer. You’ll also often see it referred to as the **terminal**. In this tutorial, we’ll use both interchangeably.
    * The instructions for how to use the command line differ slightly based on what operating system your computer uses:
        * [Command line instructions for Mac](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/)
        * [Command line instructions for Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089)
        * [Command line instructions for Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/).

In addition to the ones listed above, Gatsby uses a few more technologies under the hood. The Tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about these tools. But if you're interested in getting a head start, here's a bit more information:

* **React**: A code library (built with JavaScript) for building user interfaces. It’s the framework that Gatsby uses to build pages and structure content.
    * Learn more about React with the [React course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react).
* **GraphQL**: A query language that allows you to pull data into your website. It’s the interface that Gatsby uses for managing site data.
    * Learn more about GraphQL with the [How to GraphQL tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/).


## Installation Guide

The rest of this part of the Tutorial walks you through how to install the following tools:

* Node.js
* Git
* Gatsby CLI
* VS Code

### Node.js

### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It's a tool that helps you save different versions of your code. It also helps teammates work together on the same codebase at the same time.

When you create a new Gatsby site, Gatsby uses Git behind the scenes to download and install the required files for your new site. You will need to have Git installed to set up your first Gatsby site.

The steps to download and install Git depend on your operating system. Follow the guide for your system:

- [Install Git on macOS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x)
- [Install Git on Windows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
- [Install Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)


### Gatsby CLI

### VS Code

## Account Creation

In this Tutorial, you will learn how to deploy your site to Gatsby Cloud, so that it will be online for other people to see.

To use Gatsby Cloud, you will need to set up a GitHub account and a Gatsby Cloud account. (Both accounts are free.)

* [Create a GitHub account.](https://github.com/join) GitHub is a website for storing your Git codebases (also called Git repositories).
* [Create a Gatsby Cloud account.](/dashboard/signup/) Gatsby Cloud is a platform designed to be the best way to build and deploy your Gatsby sites.
